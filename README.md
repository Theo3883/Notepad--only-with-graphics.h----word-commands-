NOTEPAD C++ GRAPHICS.H
This project was realized with another colleague in my first year as a student at the Faculty of Computer Science. There were huge limitations, meaning that we had to do it in only Graphics.h.

The features of this project are:

Graphically displaying a fragment of a text file.
The possibility of navigating with the keys throughout the graphics window.
Ability to navigate with the mouse cursor throughout the graphics window.
The possibility to edit (add, delete) characters from the piece of text file visible in the graphics window.
Saving and restoring the modified file in the editor, in a text file.
Selection, copying, and pasting functions.
Search functions in the text file. (Displaying the number of the line)
A working scrollbar. (I mentioned this, because in graphics.h you need to simulate a scrollbar, meaning that we did it from scratch)

Used: 
  -C++
  -Graphics.h
